## ... about the final event:

* The final event will take place on **Monday, June 23, starting at 9:00 AM in Dresden at Wintergartenstraße 4**.  
  Initially, you will have the opportunity to present your results at our headquarters. Afterwards, a transfer to our second location in Radeberg (Carl-Eschebach-Straße 2) is organized, where the awards ceremony will take place following a light lunch. In Radeberg, a guided tour in station format will be held, including presentations and live demonstrations in our testing lab. Around 5:00 PM there will be a barbecue, and the return transfer to Dresden is scheduled for 6:00 PM.

* Please remember to push your final report and code to this repository by **June 18 at 12pm**, as described above, so that I have enough time to review your work before the final presentation.

* Each group will have a 30-minute slot for their final presentation. Please plan your talk so that the presentation lasts no more than 20 minutes, leaving 10 minutes for questions.

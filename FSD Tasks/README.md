# TUD WIA Seminar - Deep Learning, Neural Networks and Applications 

# in cooperation with FSD GmbH


## FSD Fahrzeugsystemdaten GmbH

This is an application-oriented course with programming assignments in Python/Tensorflow.

The course proceeds in three phases: Lecture part, project part, and excursion/project presentation. The lecture part takes place as a face-to-face event every Monday 16:40 - 18:10, Room Z21/381 and Wednesday 16:40 - 18:10, Room Z21/381 during the first six weeks of the semester (exact dates: see below).

The programming projects include tasks and datasets from automated vehicle testing and are provided by Fahrzeugsystemdaten GmbH (FSD) and co-supervised by Marina Dolokov from FSD. Since proprietary measurement data from FSD GmbH is used, a confidentiality agreement must be signed before starting the project work.

The programming assignments for the lecture part will be provided later via the Github platform and can be executed in Google Colab even without your own Python/Tensorflow installation.

#### ... about the final event:

* The final event will take place on **Monday, June 23, starting at 9:00 AM in Dresden at Wintergartenstraße 4**.  
  Initially, you will have the opportunity to present your results at our headquarters. Afterwards, a transfer to our second location in Radeberg (Carl-Eschebach-Straße 2) is organized, where the awards ceremony will take place following a light lunch. In Radeberg, a guided tour in station format will be held, including presentations and live demonstrations in our testing lab. Around 5:00 PM there will be a barbecue, and the return transfer to Dresden is scheduled for 6:00 PM.

* Please remember to push your final report and code to this repository by **June 18 at 12pm**, as described above, so that I have enough time to review your work before the final presentation.

* Each group will have a 30-minute slot for their final presentation. Please plan your talk so that the presentation lasts no more than 20 minutes, leaving 10 minutes for questions.
